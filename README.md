## Description

Description needs to be refined...

It is a full-stack MERN application ([MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)-[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)-[React](https://reactjs.org/)-[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)), deployed to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/what) with a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database using [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database). It utilizes [GraphQL API](https://graphql.org/learn/) with [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/).

## User Story

```md
AS AN individual 
WITH little to no web development experience
I WANT a site I can log in to 
IN ORDER TO get in contact with a web developer
WITH high ratings
SO THAT I can get a service done in regards to my personal website
```


## Installation and Usage

In order to run this application, you will want to `git clone` this repository so that the code is on your local machine. Run `npm i` while in the client folder, and then again in the server folder to install all necessary [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) dependencies. Then run `npm start` while in the client folder and CONCURRENTLY run `npm run watch` in the root folder in a seperate terminal to launch the server.

This application is hosted at Port 3001, so typing: `http://localhost:3001/` into the address bar of your browser (while the server is running) should display the user interface.

Alternatively, you can simply visit my [Deployed Link]().
